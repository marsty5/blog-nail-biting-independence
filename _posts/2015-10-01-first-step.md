Back in March, I posted a picture of my hands with a focus on my - lack of - nails. Friends commented and sent me private messages. They shared their struggle, empathy and suggested ways to quit this habit. I got motivated with their support. I posted another picture a week later. The same support was there, from different and even more friends. That kept me going for six weeks. I felt powerful thanks to the people who hugged my efforts. And I felt shame when they were checking on me and I had bad news for them. It was the same kind of shame I felt when I didn't make my homework at junior school.

One brought the other and I lost all the nails. And I gave up. But I didn't forget the promise I gave to myself; "I will stop biting my nails by the end of the year". So here I am, 3 months before the end of 2015. I've read somewhere that 90 days are needed to form a habit. True or not, that's my chance to make it happend this year!

Coincidentally, today 1st October we celebrate Cyprus Independence Day. Cyprus became independent from the British in 1960. What a better day to start my Nail Biting Independence era! Ha!

So, here I'm shamelessly posting the first picture and current nail status.

PS. You can say by now, I'm not publically writing a lot. Bare with me!
